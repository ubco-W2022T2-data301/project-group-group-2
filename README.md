## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our topic is Canadian housing. Currently, it is very hard for students to get housing or know where to apply.
Our data analysis seeks to understand better the trends of the housing markets across Canada and the qualitative variables of the housing in individual provinces. Canadian housing can allow students to not only determine where within Canada to move in the immediate future, but also allows a basis for comparison with other countries. The Canadian housing market is in a very volatile state right now. With enough data over a long period, if you combine the results with relevant historical events, it is possible to have some level of prediction for future housing market results. There is also qualitative data that allows us to better not only understand the house pricing, but a lot of the reasons and background as to why the pricing is the way it is. Housing will be a constant in everyone's lives. Everyone always needs a place to stay, and an analysis of Canadian housing will allow for proper decision making both within and outside of Canada for when and where to get that necessity.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset is going to be a merging of two databases/datasets.

The first database contains data on Canadian housing index costs over-time in specific locations in Canada. It is measured on a monthly basis since 1981 and although doesn't contain precise figures, can be a good determinant in analysis because it shows general trend of costs. If need be, there can be additional analysis done using index prices for relevant months and get more precise figures for the actual housing costs.

The second database contains qualitative data on the housing markets in specific locations in Canada. It was created by censuses done by Statistics Canada in each location. The censuses covered multiple relevant data points like number of rooms on average, tenant response rate and many other points. It gives a general understanding of what the housing market is like in each designated area and when combined with the first dataset on prices, gives a full understanding of the prices and market within a designated region.

Both datasets were done by Statistics Canada which is a statistics agency funded by the Canadian government to provide Canadians with accurate results and data on topics that affect Canadians. These two specific datasets were created by an agglomeration of censuses done by the Canadian government across the country, sorted by area.
