## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our topic is Canadian housing. Currently, it is very hard for students to get housing or know where to apply.
Our data analysis seeks to understand better the trends of the housing markets across canada and the qualitative variables of the housing in individual provinces. Canadian housing can allow students to not only determine where within Canada to move in the immediate future, but also allows a basis for comparison with other countries. With enough data over a long period, if you combine the results with relevent historical events, it is possible to have some level of prediction for future housing market results. Housing will be a constant in everyone's lives. Everyone always needs a place to stay, and an analysis of Canadian housing will allow for proper decision making both within and outside of Canada for when and where to get that necessity.
