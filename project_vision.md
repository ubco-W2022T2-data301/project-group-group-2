# Project Vision

Our Vision is to analyse Canadian housing so everyone can make educated housing decisions. Over the coming weeks our goal is to make a report that will include interesting visuals, optimal data and valuable conclusions on the canadian housing market. Everyone on the team has diverse backgrounds and understanding but every one of us will be looking at housing in the near future. This analysis will not only help us but many others in their house-searching journey.
