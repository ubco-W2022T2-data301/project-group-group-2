# 1 DATA 301 Final Report

### Introduction:

For our project, our group took a look at the housing market in canada in order to address some potentially common concerns involving the housing market here in canada, as it has been an important issue as of late. We took the opportunity to look at data from Stats Canada in order to come to form so data-based conclusions on ou work. Our Dataset was quite complicated, so form simplicities sake we isolated a lot of speciofic data from the Datasets, as analysing the entire dataset in all collumns would have taken ages. We crafted our research questions based on what we personally deemed the most interesting and potentially the most valuable questions that maybe other students make take some interest in. A large portion of the talk around the housing market is the pricing of the market and especially for Students at UBC Vancouver, and increasingly UBCO as well, the price of Housing has looked worse year-to-year. Following from that we will each give a short synopsis of some of the EDA discoveries that we each made, and how it may either enforce or scew our final results, or if it was just an interesting fact.



##### Jack's EDA findings: 
Because my research question delved into the trends in value over the past year, The largest and most interesting EDA findings I had was the Differences between provinces in terms of Value over time. The biggest Outlier that I personally found was actually the entire province of BC up untill the mid 2000's.

While almost all the other provinces had most only increase in value over time, BC had a completely sparatic history, with having massive shifts in value. While the other graphs seemed so reflect more of a trend that may mirror what people would expect, BC's history of values looks more like a roller coater you would find at a theme park. What make it so interesting was that the value was so large, even back in 1981. BC was by far the most expensive place to live for a very long time, yet it still had massive ups and downs, which indicate there may be more to that story. Looking deeper into the topic, Vancouver Hosted the EXPO 86 a massive wolrdwide event that skyrocked the prices of basically everything in Vancouver, subsequently, the sharp decrease in housing prices right ater could have been due to the fallout after the event.

Another smaller thing I would like to also mention is that in terms of provinces, Ontario was the  most linear in terms of the increases, which in my personal opinion could have been due to the goverment being situated there, perhaps resulting in more attention to stricter housing price guidlines. Following that Alberta Seemed to experience the least linear (outside BC) and was affected the most by the 2008 crash and 2019 COVID outbreak. Contrary to Ontario this could potentially be due to Alberta generally being more conservative, and therefore more lax on the rules of the housing market. Tha allowed land owners to list prices at very high prices during rough times which could have caused the sharp increases you can see on the graphs.

#### Reasearch Question 1 (Jack) and results:
So for my reaserch question, I looked at the trends in value across canada to see if there is any sort of a pattern that could lead to any conclusions about the potential next few years.

While Analysing the Data, the most intersting parts were definetely the 2008 market crash, as well as the 2019 COVID Pandemic. Both of these events sparked a large increase in the prices of houses, and because COVID was rather recent, and the fact that we are approaching the tail end of the Pandemic, if there are enough parralels between the the 2 events, it could help in determining the near future.

Looking at the behavior of the 2008 crisis, we can see a large increase in prices as expected. Alberta and Manitoba/Saskachewan were the most affected areas, while Ontario and Quebec were the least affected (EDA findings indicated why this may be). Following the large increase4 across the country, we saw a sort of plateau as the prices of houses increased at a slower rate than in years prior. This follows simply economic logic that a continuos large increase in prices is never sustainable, and thus the market flattened out. 

Comparing this to 2019, we see a very similar trend. A very large pike in prices, which was even larger than 2008, which was significantly noticable across te entire country. Every single province saw record high housing index value and the largest contributor to this is likely the COVID-19 Pandemic. While COVID has a massive effect in all secotrs, not just housing, The housing market was definetely affected. Now that we are (mostly) out of the high restrictions part of the pandemic, and life has begun to return to normal, there is a small sample size of Data that stops the sharp slope in all areas. Looking to 2008 and comparing to after recovery had started, we are beginning to see the same trends. 

This leads me to what my data-based conclusion to my reaserch question: I believe that the next few years, it will plateaus like it did in 2008. While working with Tableau, they also had a feature which predicts a short time in the future of Data, and looking at that, it seems to indicated data that supported my conclusion. While it is definetely not set in stone, provided that there are no more disasters in the economy, I feel confident in my conclusion.
